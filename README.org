#+title: Personal Doom Emacs config

Finally, a Doom-based config (migrating from Spacemacs), with the aim of having
"less framework in my framework".

Highlights:
- robust and efficient email with mu4e
- navigation with etags
- projects magic: separate org nodes per project, default makefile, default-file-to-view, etc.
- org-ref
- open file in default app (from Dired)
